        "It is dark in the village of Manchester. A light mist, ever so slowly, falls and gives the stones along the road a glossy sheen. "
        + "Through the mist, the lines and edges of the buildings, and dim light from the street lanterns are all slightly blurred. "
        + "You would have to be close to determine if something was real, or just a trick of your eyes and imagination.",
        "The good people of Manchester are behind those dark windows, in their beds asleep, oblivious to anything outside of their dreams.",
        "But the Doctor is not a good person, his windows are full of light, and he is trying to manifest his dream through furious experimentation. "
        + "Machines crackle and whir, indicator lights flash, as the Doctor runs through his dial checks. "
        + "'It's time. Everything is functioning perfectly. You! get over here!'",
        "You stand up from your simple, wooden chair. 'Yes, Doctor.' And walk to the Doctor.",
        "'The time has finally come. You know what to do? I must have all of the parts tonight, they must be fresh, by tomorrow they will not be viable. "
        + "I must have all of the parts, this is very important. Nothing can be missing. Any parts you dont deliver, I will have to take from you.'",
        "'Yes, Doctor.'",

        "'And the book, Doctor?'",
        "'That,' he said pointing at the book, 'is a useful book. If you are feeling lost, open the book to a random page. You will be presented with a riddle. "
        + "Answer the riddle and the next best step will be shown to you.'",
        "'Oh, and look out for the damned cops. If they catch you with parts in your bag, they is sure to arrest you. "
        + "You can always bring the parts back here as you find them, so you won't have any parts for the cops to find. Now get going! Time is of the essence!'",

        + "Throw the switch.' he says, pointing to a large switch on the wall, without looking up from the body.",

        "Yelling over the sound of the machines, and also out of excitement, 'Increase the amperage by 3 milli volts, decrease the frequency by 2 hertz. "
        "We need to match the body's chemical-electric profile.'",
        "You make the adjustments, and the doctor keeps a close watch on the body.",
        "After a few moments you hear an agonized, 'Noooo...', as the doctor begins beating on the chest of the body. 'What did I do wrong? These settings should be perfect.'",
        "The doctor collapses to his knees, muttering to himself. You see a small puff of smoke rise from the body on the table. Best to turn off the machines.",
        "In the new quiet of the room, You can hear the doctor crying and cussing under his breath.",
        "'Fuck, just going to have to do this all over again.' You think to yourself. And you head off to bed."

        "You turn to run toward the closest edge of town, when a firm hand grabs you from behind. 'There you are, you little shit. "
        + "The good doctor called into the precinct and said you had some things that where his, and I was supposed to take you back to him so he can take those things back.'",
